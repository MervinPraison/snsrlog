snsrlog
=======

snsrlog is an iOS application helping researchers and interested users to view, record and stream sensor data in real-time.

During the recording of movements, one can label the data so that it's easy to distinguish the different parts of a signal at a later point. Furthermore, the sensor data can be streamed (via WiFi or Bluetooth) to another device running snsrlog, so that labelling can be performed remotely.
 
Recordings can be uploaded to any computer using iTunes file sharing.

Please note that continued recording of mobile phone sensor data (especially GPS) can dramatically decrease battery life.

This application was inspired by previous work of Tobias Franke, David Bannach and Kai Kunze.
